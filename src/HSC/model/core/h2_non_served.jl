    h2_non_served(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)

This function defines the non-served hydrogen demand decision variable $x_{s,z,t}^{\textrm{H,NSD}} \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}$, representing the total amount of hydrogen demand curtailed in demand segment $s$ at time period $t$ in zone $z$. 
The first segment of non-served hydrogen, $s=1$, is used to denote the cost of involuntary hydrogen demand curtailment, specified as the value of $c_{1}^{\textrm{H,NSD}}$.
Additional segments, $s \geq 2$ can be used to specify a segment-wise approximation of a price elastic hydrogen demand curve, or segments of price-responsive curtailable hydrogen loads.
Each segment denotes a price/cost at which the segment of hydrogen demand is willing to curtail consumption, $\textrm{n}_{s}^{\textrm{H,NSD}}$, representing the marginal willingness to pay for hydrogen demand of this segment of demand (or opportunity cost incurred when demand is not served) 
and a maximum quantity of demand in this segment, $\textrm{n}_{s}^{\textrm{H,NSD}}$, specified as a share of hydrogen demand in each zone in each time step, $\textrm{D}_{z, t}^{\textrm{H}}$. Note that the current implementation assumes demand segments are an equal share of hourly load in all zones.

The variable defined in this file named after ```vH2NSE``` covers the variable $x_{s,z,t}^{\textrm{H,NSD}}$.

**Cost expressions**

This function defines contributions to the objective function from the cost of non-served hydrogen/curtailed hydrogen from all demand curtailment segments $s \in \mathcal{SEG}$ over all time periods $t \in \mathcal{T}$ and all zones $z \in \mathcal{Z}$:

```math
\begin{equation*}
    \textrm{C}^{\textrm{H,NSD},o} = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{SEG}} \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \omega_t \times \textrm{n}_{s}^{\textrm{H,NSD}} \times x_{s,z,t}^{\textrm{H,NSD}}
\end{equation*}
```

Contributions to the hydrogen balance expression from non-served hydrogen/curtailed hydrogen from each demand segment $s \in \mathcal{SEG}$ are also defined as:

```math
\begin{equation*}
    HydrogenBal_{NSE} = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{SEG}} x_{s,z,t}^{\textrm{H,NSD}} \quad \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
\end{equation*}
```

**Bounds on curtailable hydrogen demand**

Hydrogen demand curtailed in each segment of curtailable demands $s \in \mathcal{SEG}$ cannot exceed maximum allowable share of hydrogen demand:

```math
\begin{equation*}
    x_{s,z,t}^{\textrm{H,NSD}} \leq \textrm{n}_{s}^{\textrm{H,NSD}} \times \textrm{D}_{z,t}^{\textrm{H}} \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{SEG}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
\end{equation*}
```

Additionally, total demand curtailed in each time step cannot exceed total hydrogen demand:

```math
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{s \in \mathcal{SEG}} x_{s,z,t}^{\textrm{H,NSD}} \leq \textrm{D}_{z,t}^{\textrm{H}} \quad \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
\end{equation*}
```
